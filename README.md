**The integration of quantum computing and digital hardware design**

- Requirements
  -  Qiskit for quantum circuit simulation 
  -  SystemVerilog knowledge for FPGA programming
  -  FPGA hardware

- Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are versatile hardware platforms that can be reconfigured to implement custom logic circuits, making them potentially suitable for accelerating certain aspects of quantum circuit simulation.
-  This involves solving various technical challenges related to **qubit representation, gate mapping, quantum state simulation, and optimization**.

+ STEPS
  + Quantum Circuit Simulation with Qiskit
  + Define the FPGA Implementation in SystemVerilog  (e.g., Xilinx Vivado or Intel Quartus)
  + Test FPGA Emulation
  + Debug and refine
